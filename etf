Hi all, 　

It was a pleasure meeting you this morning and I am looking forward to working with you over the summer months!　

Below is the project outline we discussed and some resources that you may find helpful. 　

ETF Sales Targeting: How to Connect with Millennials　

Project Outline:　

1. Millennials and their use of ETFs - likely to be a significant group driving the growth of ETFs going forward (BlackRock ETF Pulse Survey)　
2. Investment preferences (themes, ESG, SRI) - list new ETFs targeting millennials　
3. Distribution strategies targeting millennials - how advisors are connecting with millennial end investors (robo-advisors, digital financial planning solutions, social media strategies); give examples

http://www.etf.com/ - Comprehensive database for ETFs; the ETF University link contains educational articles, videos. I recommend you taking a brief look to refresh you knowledge on the ETF vehicle

This is just an initial list with some resource suggestions, but you could find many more helpful sources. 　

As next steps, please reach out to me when you are ready to have our first check in meeting. I am out of office the week of June 26, but back the following week (7/5). 　

A day or two before our next meeting, please send me the research you have done at that point, this would allow me to review in advance and prepare some comments so we have a more productive meeting. 　

Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, or if you just want to discuss specific finding/sources, or have trouble finding the right statistics. 　

My best,　
Iva
