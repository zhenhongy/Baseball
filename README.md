# Baseball
+ This is a Bayesian practice in analyzing Baseball statistics. Many thanks to the great blog @[Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/).

------------
### Objective
Faily evaluating the performance of a player could be hard sometimes when there is little information available. It might be suspicious to say a player, who keeps a record of batting average 8/10, is better than another one, who gets an average 200/500. Now, let Bayesian Statistics make help. This practice was conducted under the guidance from blog @[Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/). It covers empirical Bayesian prior estimates, hierarchical modeling, mixture model, hypothese testing and simulation.
